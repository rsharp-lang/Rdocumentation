        <h2>Gaussian elimination</h2>

        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p><br /> In mathematics, Gaussian elimination, also known as row reduction, is an algorithm <br /> for solving systems of linear equations. It consists of a sequence of row-wise <br /> operations performed on the corresponding matrix of coefficients. This method can <br /> also be used to compute the rank of a matrix, the determinant of a square matrix, <br /> and the inverse of an invertible matrix. The method is named after Carl Friedrich <br /> Gauss (1777â€“1855). To perform row reduction on a matrix, one uses a sequence of<br /> elementary row operations to modify the matrix until the lower left-hand corner of <br /> the matrix is filled with zeros, as much as possible. There are three types of <br /> elementary row operations:<br /> <br /> + Swapping two rows,<br /> + Multiplying a row by a nonzero number,<br /> + Adding a multiple Of one row To another row.<br /> <br /> Using these operations, a matrix can always be transformed into an upper triangular<br /> matrix, And In fact one that Is In row echelon form. Once all Of the leading coefficients <br /> (the leftmost nonzero entry In Each row) are 1, And every column containing a leading<br /> coefficient has zeros elsewhere, the matrix Is said To be In reduced row echelon form.<br /> This final form Is unique; In other words, it Is independent Of the sequence Of row<br /> operations used. For example, In the following sequence Of row operations (where two <br /> elementary operations On different rows are done at the first And third steps), the <br /> third And fourth matrices are the ones In row echelon form, And the final matrix Is <br /> the unique reduced row echelon form.</p>
