        <h2>Adjust P-values for Multiple Comparisons</h2>

        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p><br /> Given a set of p-values, returns p-values adjusted <br /> using one of several methods.</p>

        <h3>Usage</h3>

        <div style="width: 100%; padding-left: 3%; color: black;">
            <pre><code class='language-R' style="color: black; font-weight:normal;"><strong>p.adjust</strong>(<i>p</i>,
    <i>method</i> = fdr,
    <i>n</i> = <span style='color: blue !important;'>NULL</span>);</code></pre>
        </div>

        <h3>Arguments</h3>

        <table>
            
<dt>p</dt>
<dd><p><p>numeric vector Of p-values (possibly With NAs). Any other R Object Is <br />
 coerced by As.numeric.</p></p></dd>


<dt>method</dt>
<dd><p><p>correction method. Can be abbreviated.</p></p></dd>


<dt>n</dt>
<dd><p><p>number of comparisons, must be at least length(p); only set this (to <br />
 non-default) when you know what you are doing!</p></p></dd>


<dt>env</dt>
<dd><p><p>-</p></p></dd>

        <h3 style="display: block;">Details</h3>

        <p>The adjustment methods include the Bonferroni correction ("bonferroni") <br />
 in which the p-values are multiplied by the number of comparisons. Less<br />
 conservative corrections are also included by Holm (1979) ("holm"), <br />
 Hochberg (1988) ("hochberg"), Hommel (1988) ("hommel"), Benjamini &amp; <br />
 Hochberg (1995) ("BH" or its alias "fdr"), and Benjamini &amp; Yekutieli <br />
 (2001) ("BY"), respectively. A pass-through option ("none") is also included.<br />
 The set of methods are contained in the p.adjust.methods vector for the <br />
 benefit of methods that need to have the method as an option and pass it <br />
 on to p.adjust.</p>

<p>The first four methods are designed To give strong control Of the family-wise <br />
 Error rate. There seems no reason To use the unmodified Bonferroni correction <br />
 because it Is dominated by Holm's method, which is also valid under arbitrary<br />
 assumptions.</p>

<p>Hochberg's and Hommel's methods are valid when the hypothesis tests are <br />
 independent or when they are non-negatively associated (Sarkar, 1998; Sarkar <br />
 and Chang, 1997). Hommel's method is more powerful than Hochberg's, but the <br />
 difference is usually small and the Hochberg p-values are faster to compute.<br />
 The "BH" (aka "fdr") And "BY" method of Benjamini, Hochberg, And Yekutieli <br />
 control the false discovery rate, the expected proportion of false discoveries<br />
 amongst the rejected hypotheses. The false discovery rate Is a less stringent <br />
 condition than the family-wise error rate, so these methods are more powerful <br />
 than the others.</p>

<p>Note that you can Set n larger than length(p) which means the unobserved<br />
 p-values are assumed To be greater than all the observed p For "bonferroni" <br />
 And "holm" methods And equal To 1 For the other methods.</p>


        <h3>Value</h3>

        <p>A numeric vector of corrected p-values (of the same length as p, with names <br />
 copied from p).</p><h4>clr value class</h4><ul><li>double</li></ul>
