        <p>Silhouette score is used to evaluate the quality of clusters created using clustering <br />
 algorithms such as K-Means in terms of how well samples are clustered with other samples <br />
 that are similar to each other. The Silhouette score is calculated for each sample of <br />
 different clusters. To calculate the Silhouette score for each observation/data point, <br />
 the following distances need to be found out for each observations belonging to all the <br />
 clusters:</p>

<p>Mean distance between the observation And all other data points In the same cluster. This<br />
 distance can also be called a mean intra-cluster distance. The mean distance Is denoted by a<br />
 Mean distance between the observation And all other data points Of the Next nearest cluster.<br />
 This distance can also be called a mean nearest-cluster distance. The mean distance Is <br />
 denoted by b</p>

<p>Silhouette score, S, for Each sample Is calculated Using the following formula:</p>

<p>(S = \frac{(b - a)}{max(a, b)})</p>

<p>The value Of the Silhouette score varies from -1 To 1. If the score Is 1, the cluster Is<br />
 dense And well-separated than other clusters. A value near 0 represents overlapping clusters<br />
 With samples very close To the decision boundary Of the neighboring clusters. A negative <br />
 score [-1, 0] indicates that the samples might have got assigned To the wrong clusters.</p>
