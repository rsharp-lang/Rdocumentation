<p>The Open Office XML-based spreadsheet format using .xlsx as a file extension 
 has been the default format produced for new documents by versions of Microsoft 
 Excel since Excel 2007. The format was designed to be equivalent to the binary 
 .xls format produced by earlier versions of Microsoft Excel (see MS-XLS). For
 convenience, this format description uses XLSX to identify the corresponding 
 format. The primary content of a XLSX file is marked up in SpreadsheetML, which 
 is specified in parts 1 and 4 of ISO/IEC 29500, Information technology -- Document
 description and processing languages -- Office Open XML File Formats (OOXML). 
 This description focuses on the specification in ISO/IEC 29500:2012 and represents
 the format variant known as "Transitional." Although editions of ISO 29500 were 
 published in 2008, 2011, 2012, and 2016, the specification has had very few 
 changes other than clarifications and corrections to match actual usage in 
 documents since SpreadsheetML was first standardized in ECMA-376, Part 1 in 2006.
 This description can be read as applying to all SpreadsheetML versions published 
 by ECMA International and by ISO/IEC through 2016. See Notes below for more 
 detail on the chronological versions and differences.</p>

<p>The XLSX format uses the SpreadsheetML markup language And schema To represent a 
 spreadsheet "document." Conceptually, Using the terminology Of the Spreadsheet 
 ML specification In ISO/IEC 29500-1, the document comprises one Or more worksheets
 In a workbook. A worksheet typically consists Of a rectangular grid Of cells. 
 Each cell can contain a value Or a formula, which will be used To calculate a value,
 With a cached value usually stored pending the Next recalculation. A Single 
 spreadsheet document may serve several purposes: as a container for data values; 
 as program code (based on the formulas in cells) to perform analyses on those 
 values; And as one Or more formatted reports (including charts) of the analyses. 
 Beyond basics, spreadsheet applications have introduced support for more advanced
 features over time. These include mechanisms to extract data dynamically from external
 sources, to support collaborative work, And to perform an increasing number of 
 functions that would have required a database application in the past, such as sorting
 And filtering of entries in a table to display a temporary subset. The markup 
 specification must support both basic And more advanced functionalities in a structure
 that supports the robust performance expected by users.</p>
