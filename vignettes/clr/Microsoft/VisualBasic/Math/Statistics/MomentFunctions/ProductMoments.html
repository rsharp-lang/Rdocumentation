        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>In statistics, moments are a set of numerical characteristics that describe the shape and features of a probability distribution. 
 Sample moments are the same concept applied to a sample of data, rather than an entire population. They are used to estimate 
 the corresponding population moments and to understand the properties of the data distribution.
 
 Here's a basic introduction to the concept of sample moments:
 
 ### Definition:
 
 1. <strong>Sample Mean (First Moment):</strong>
    The sample mean is the average of the data points in a sample. It is a measure of the central tendency of the data.
      \[
      \bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum<em>{i=1}^{n} x</em>i
      \]
    where \( x_i \) are the data points and \( n \) is the number of data points in the sample.
 2. <strong>Sample Variance (Second Central Moment):</strong>
    The sample variance measures the spread or dispersion of the data points around the sample mean.
      \[
      s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum<em>{i=1}^{n} (x</em>i - \bar{x})^2
      \]
    The denominator \( n-1 \) is used instead of \( n \) to provide an unbiased estimate of the population variance.
 3. <strong>Sample Standard Deviation:</strong>
    The sample standard deviation is the square root of the sample variance and is also a measure of dispersion.
      \[
      s = \sqrt{s^2}
      \]
 4. <strong>Higher-Order Sample Moments:</strong>
    Higher-order moments describe the shape of the distribution. For example:
    - <strong>Third Moment:</strong> Measures skewness, which indicates the asymmetry of the data distribution.
    - <strong>Fourth Moment:</strong> Measures kurtosis, which indicates the "tailedness" of the data distribution.
    
 ### Calculation:
 
 To calculate sample moments, you simply apply the formulas to your data set. For instance, to find the sample mean,
 you add up all the data points and divide by the number of points.
 
 ### Use:
 
 Sample moments are used to:
 - Estimate population parameters.
 - Assess the shape of the data distribution (e.g., normality, skewness, kurtosis).
 - Form the basis for many statistical tests and procedures.
 
 ### Properties:
 - <strong>Unbiasedness:</strong> Some sample moments are designed to be unbiased estimators, meaning that the expected value of the sample moment equals the population moment.
 - <strong>Efficiency:</strong> Different sample moments may have different levels of variability; some are more efficient than others.
 - <strong>Robustness:</strong> Certain moments are more robust to outliers than others.
 
 ### Example:
 If you have a sample of data: \( \{2, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 9\} \), you can calculate the sample mean, variance, 
 and other moments to understand the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of the data distribution.
 
 sample moments are fundamental tools in statistics for summarizing and understanding the characteristics of
 a data set. They provide a way to quantify features such as location, spread, and shape, which are essential 
 for further statistical analysis.
