        <h2>Data Sets</h2>

        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p><br /> Loads specified data sets, or list the available data sets.</p>

        <h3>Usage</h3>

        <div style="width: 100%; padding-left: 3%; color: black;">
            <pre><code class='language-R' style="color: black; font-weight:normal;"><strong>data</strong>(<i>x</i>,
    <i>package</i> = <span style='color: blue !important;'>NULL</span>,
    <i>lib.loc</i> = <span style='color: blue !important;'>NULL</span>);</code></pre>
        </div>

        <h3>Arguments</h3>

        <table>
            
<dt>x</dt>
<dd><p><p>literal character strings Or names.</p></p></dd>


<dt>package</dt>
<dd><p><p>a character vector giving the package(s) to look in for data sets, or NULL.<br />
 By Default, all packages in the search path are used, then the 'data’ <br />
 subdirectory (if present) of the current working directory.</p></p></dd>


<dt>lib.loc</dt>
<dd><p><p>a character vector of directory names of R libraries, or NULL. <br />
 The default value of NULL corresponds to all libraries currently <br />
 known.</p></p></dd>


<dt>env</dt>
<dd><p><p>-</p></p></dd>

        <h3 style="display: block;">Details</h3>

        <p>Currently, four formats of data files are supported:</p>

<pre><code>1. files ending ‘.R’ or ‘.r’ are source()d in, with the R working directory changed 
   temporarily to the directory containing the respective file. (data ensures that the 
   utils package is attached, in case it had been run via utils::data.)
2. files ending ‘.RData’ or ‘.rda’ are load()ed.
3. files ending ‘.tab’, ‘.txt’ or ‘.TXT’ are read using read.table(..., header = TRUE, as.is=FALSE), 
   and hence result in a data frame.
4. files ending ‘.csv’ or ‘.CSV’ are read using read.table(..., header = TRUE, sep = ";", as.is=FALSE), 
   and also result in a data frame.
</code></pre>

<p>If more than one matching file name is found, the first on this list is used. (Files with <br />
 extensions ‘.txt’, ‘.tab’ or ‘.csv’ can be compressed, with or without further <br />
 extension ‘.gz’, ‘.bz2’ or ‘.xz’.)</p>

<p>The data sets to be loaded can be specified as a set of character strings or names, or as <br />
 the character vector list, or as both.</p>

<p>For each given data set, the first two types (‘.R’ or ‘.r’, and ‘.RData’ or ‘.rda’ <br />
 files) can create several variables in the load environment, which might all be named differently <br />
 from the data set. The third and fourth types will always result in the creation of a single <br />
 variable with the same name (without extension) as the data set.</p>

<p>If no data sets are specified, data lists the available data sets. It looks for a new-style <br />
 data index in the ‘Meta’ or, if this is not found, an old-style ‘00Index’ file in the ‘data’ <br />
 directory of each specified package, and uses these files to prepare a listing. If there is a <br />
 ‘data’ area but no index, available data files for loading are computed and included in the <br />
 listing, and a warning is given: such packages are incomplete. The information about available <br />
 data sets is returned in an object of class "packageIQR". The structure of this class is experimental. <br />
 Where the datasets have a different name from the argument that should be used to retrieve them <br />
 the index will have an entry like beaver1 (beavers) which tells us that dataset beaver1 can be <br />
 retrieved by the call data(beaver).</p>

<p>If lib.loc and package are both NULL (the default), the data sets are searched for in all the <br />
 currently loaded packages then in the ‘data’ directory (if any) of the current working <br />
 directory.</p>

<p>If lib.loc = NULL but package is specified as a character vector, the specified package(s) are <br />
 searched for first amongst loaded packages and then in the default library/ies (see .libPaths).</p>

<p>If lib.loc is specified (and not NULL), packages are searched for in the specified library/ies, <br />
 even if they are already loaded from another library.</p>

<p>To just look in the ‘data’ directory of the current working directory, set package = character(0) <br />
 (and lib.loc = NULL, the default).</p>
