<dt>package</dt>
<dd><p>a character vector giving the package(s) to look in for data sets, or NULL.

        <h3 style="display: block;">Details</h3>

        <p>Currently, four formats of data files are supported:
 
    1. files ending ‘.R’ or ‘.r’ are source()d in, with the R working directory changed 
       temporarily to the directory containing the respective file. (data ensures that the 
       utils package is attached, in case it had been run via utils::data.)
    2. files ending ‘.RData’ or ‘.rda’ are load()ed.
    3. files ending ‘.tab’, ‘.txt’ or ‘.TXT’ are read using read.table(..., header = TRUE, as.is=FALSE), 
       and hence result in a data frame.
    4. files ending ‘.csv’ or ‘.CSV’ are read using read.table(..., header = TRUE, sep = ";", as.is=FALSE), 
       and also result in a data frame.
       
 If more than one matching file name is found, the first on this list is used. (Files with 
 extensions ‘.txt’, ‘.tab’ or ‘.csv’ can be compressed, with or without further 
 extension ‘.gz’, ‘.bz2’ or ‘.xz’.)
 
 The data sets to be loaded can be specified as a set of character strings or names, or as 
 the character vector list, or as both.
 
 For each given data set, the first two types (‘.R’ or ‘.r’, and ‘.RData’ or ‘.rda’ 
 files) can create several variables in the load environment, which might all be named differently 
 from the data set. The third and fourth types will always result in the creation of a single 
 variable with the same name (without extension) as the data set.
 
 If no data sets are specified, data lists the available data sets. It looks for a new-style 
 data index in the ‘Meta’ or, if this is not found, an old-style ‘00Index’ file in the ‘data’ 
 directory of each specified package, and uses these files to prepare a listing. If there is a 
 ‘data’ area but no index, available data files for loading are computed and included in the 
 listing, and a warning is given: such packages are incomplete. The information about available 
 data sets is returned in an object of class "packageIQR". The structure of this class is experimental. 
 Where the datasets have a different name from the argument that should be used to retrieve them 
 the index will have an entry like beaver1 (beavers) which tells us that dataset beaver1 can be 
 retrieved by the call data(beaver).
 
 If lib.loc and package are both NULL (the default), the data sets are searched for in all the 
 currently loaded packages then in the ‘data’ directory (if any) of the current working 
 directory.
 
 If lib.loc = NULL but package is specified as a character vector, the specified package(s) are 
 searched for first amongst loaded packages and then in the default library/ies (see .libPaths).
 
 If lib.loc is specified (and not NULL), packages are searched for in the specified library/ies, 
 even if they are already loaded from another library.
 
 To just look in the ‘data’ directory of the current working directory, set package = character(0) 
 (and lib.loc = NULL, the default).</p>
