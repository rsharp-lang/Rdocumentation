        <h2>Sorting or Ordering Vectors</h2>

        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p><br /> Sort (or order) a vector or factor (partially) into ascending <br /> or descending order. For ordering along more than one variable, <br /> e.g., for sorting data frames, see order.</p>

        <h3>Usage</h3>

        <div style="width: 100%; padding-left: 3%; color: black;">
            <pre><code class='language-R' style="color: black; font-weight:normal;"><strong>sort</strong>(<i>x</i>,
    <i>decreasing</i> = <span style='color: blue !important;'>FALSE</span>,
    <i>na.last</i> = <span style='color: blue !important;'>FALSE</span>);</code></pre>
        </div>

        <h3>Arguments</h3>

        <table>
            
<dt>x</dt>
<dd><p><p>For sort an R object with a class Or a numeric, complex, <br />
 character Or logical vector. For sort.int, a numeric, complex, <br />
 character Or logical vector, Or a factor.</p></p></dd>


<dt>decreasing</dt>
<dd><p><p>logical. Should the sort be increasing or decreasing? For the <br />
 "radix" method, this can be a vector of length equal to the <br />
 number of arguments in .... For the other methods, it must be <br />
 length one. Not available for partial sorting.</p></p></dd>


<dt>na.last</dt>
<dd><p><p>for controlling the treatment of NAs. If TRUE, missing values <br />
 in the data are put last; if FALSE, they are put first; if NA, <br />
 they are removed.</p></p></dd>

        <h3 style="display: block;">Details</h3>

        <p>sort is a generic function for which methods can be written, and <br />
 sort.int is the internal method which is compatible with S if <br />
 only the first three arguments are used.<br />
 The Default sort method makes use Of order For classed objects, <br />
 which In turn makes use Of the generic Function xtfrm (And can be <br />
 slow unless a xtfrm method has been defined Or Is.numeric(x) Is <br />
 True).<br />
 Complex values are sorted first by the real part, Then the imaginary <br />
 part.<br />
 The "auto" method selects "radix" for short (less than 2^31 elements) <br />
 numeric vectors, integer vectors, logical vectors And factors; <br />
 otherwise, "shell".<br />
 Except for method "radix", the sort order for character vectors will <br />
 depend on the collating sequence of the locale in use: see Comparison. <br />
 The sort order For factors Is the order Of their levels (which Is <br />
 particularly appropriate For ordered factors).<br />
 If partial Is Not NULL, it Is taken to contain indices of elements of <br />
 the result which are to be placed in their correct positions in the <br />
 sorted array by partial sorting. For each of the result values in <br />
 a specified position, any values smaller than that one are guaranteed <br />
 to have a smaller index in the sorted array And any values which <br />
 are greater are guaranteed to have a bigger index in the sorted array. <br />
 (This Is included for efficiency, And many of the options are Not <br />
 available for partial sorting. It Is only substantially more efficient <br />
 if partial has a handful of elements, And a full sort Is done (a <br />
 Quicksort if possible) if there are more than 10.) Names are discarded <br />
 for partial sorting.<br />
 Method "shell" uses Shellsort (an O(n^{4/3}) variant from Sedgewick <br />
 (1986)). If x has names a stable modification Is used, so ties are Not <br />
 reordered. (This only matters if names are present.)<br />
 Method "quick" uses Singleton (1969)'s implementation of Hoare's <br />
 Quicksort method and is only available when x is numeric (double or <br />
 integer) and partial is NULL. (For other types of x Shellsort is used, <br />
 silently.) It is normally somewhat faster than Shellsort (perhaps 50% <br />
 faster on vectors of length a million and twice as fast at a billion)<br />
 but has poor performance in the rare worst case. (Peto's modification <br />
 using a pseudo-random midpoint is used to make the worst case rarer.) <br />
 This is not a stable sort, and ties may be reordered.<br />
 Method "radix" relies on simple hashing to scale time linearly with <br />
 the input size, i.e., its asymptotic time complexity Is O(n). The specific <br />
 variant And its implementation originated from the data.table package <br />
 And are due to Matt Dowle And Arun Srinivasan. For small inputs (&lt; 200), <br />
 the implementation uses an insertion sort (O(n^2)) that operates in-place <br />
 to avoid the allocation overhead of the radix sort. For integer vectors <br />
 of range less than 100,000, it switches to a simpler And faster linear <br />
 time counting sort. In all cases, the sort Is stable; the order of ties <br />
 Is preserved. It Is the default method for integer vectors And factors.<br />
 The "radix" method generally outperforms the other methods, especially <br />
 for character vectors And small integers. Compared to quick sort, it Is <br />
 slightly faster for vectors with large integer Or real values (but unlike <br />
 quick sort, radix Is stable And supports all na.last options). The <br />
 implementation Is orders of magnitude faster than shell sort for character <br />
 vectors, in part thanks to clever use of the internal CHARSXP table.<br />
 However, there are some caveats with the radix sort<br />
 If x Is a character vector, all elements must share the same encoding. <br />
 Only UTF-8 (including ASCII) And Latin-1 encodings are supported. Collation <br />
 always follows the "C" locale.<br />
 Long vectors(with more than 2^32 elements) And complex vectors are Not <br />
 supported yet.</p>


        <h3>Value</h3>

        <p>For sort, the result depends on the S3 method which is dispatched. If <br />
 x does not have a class sort.int is used and it description applies. <br />
 For classed objects which do not have a specific method the default method <br />
 will be used and is equivalent to x[order(x, ...)]: this depends on the <br />
 class having a suitable method for [ (and also that order will work, <br />
 which requires a xtfrm method).<br />
 For sort.int the value Is the sorted vector unless index.return Is true, <br />
 when the result Is a list with components named x And ix containing the <br />
 sorted numbers And the ordering index vector. In the latter case, if <br />
 method == "quick" ties may be reversed in the ordering (unlike sort.list) <br />
 as quicksort Is Not stable. For method == "radix", index.return Is <br />
 supported for all na.last modes. The other methods only support index.return <br />
 when na.last Is NA. The index vector refers To element numbers after removal <br />
 Of NAs: see order If you want the original element numbers.<br />
 All attributes are removed from the Return value (see Becker et al, 1988, <br />
 p.146) except names, which are sorted. (If Partial Is specified even the <br />
 names are removed.) Note that this means that the returned value has no <br />
 Class, except For factors And ordered factors (which are treated specially <br />
 And whose result Is transformed back To the original Class).</p><h4>clr value class</h4><ul><li><i>any</i> kind</li></ul>
