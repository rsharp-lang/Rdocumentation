        <h2>Object Attribute Lists</h2>

        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p><br /> These functions access an object's attributes. The first form <br /> below returns the object's attribute list. The replacement <br /> forms uses the list on the right-hand side of the assignment <br /> as the object's attributes (if appropriate).</p>

        <h3>Usage</h3>

        <div style="width: 100%; padding-left: 3%; color: black;">
            <pre><code class='language-R' style="color: black; font-weight:normal;"><strong>attributes</strong>(<i>x</i>);</code></pre>
        </div>

        <h3>Arguments</h3>

        <table>
            
<dt>x</dt>
<dd><p>any R object</p></dd>

        </table>


        <h3 style="display: block;">Details</h3>

        <p>Unlike attr it is not an error to set attributes on a NULL object:
 it will first be coerced to an empty list.
 
 Note that some attributes (namely Class, comment, Dim, dimnames, 
 names, row.names And tsp) are treated specially And have restrictions
 On the values which can be Set. (Note that this Is Not True Of 
 levels which should be Set For factors via the levels replacement 
 Function.)
 
 Attributes are Not stored internally As a list And should be thought
 Of As a Set And Not a vector, i.e, the order Of the elements Of 
 attributes() does Not matter. This Is also reflected by identical()'s
 behaviour with the default argument attrib.as.set = TRUE. Attributes 
 must have unique names (and NA is taken as "NA", not a missing value).
 
 Assigning attributes first removes all attributes, Then sets any Dim 
 attribute And Then the remaining attributes In the order given: this
 ensures that setting a Dim attribute always precedes the dimnames 
 attribute.
 
 The mostattributes assignment takes special care For the Dim, names And
 dimnames attributes, And assigns them only When known To be valid 
 whereas an attributes assignment would give an Error If any are Not. 
 It Is principally intended For arrays, And should be used With care
 On classed objects. For example, it does Not check that row.names
 are assigned correctly For data frames.
 
 The names Of a pairlist are Not stored As attributes, but are reported 
 As If they were (And can be Set by the replacement form Of attributes).
 
 NULL objects cannot have attributes And attempts To assign them will
 promote the Object To an empty list. Both assignment And replacement
 forms Of attributes are primitive functions.</p>
