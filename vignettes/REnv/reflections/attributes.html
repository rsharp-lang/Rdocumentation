        <h2>Object Attribute Lists</h2>

        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p><br /> These functions access an object's attributes. The first form <br /> below returns the object's attribute list. The replacement <br /> forms uses the list on the right-hand side of the assignment <br /> as the object's attributes (if appropriate).</p>

        <h3>Usage</h3>

        <div style="width: 100%; padding-left: 3%; color: black;">
            <pre><code class='language-R' style="color: black; font-weight:normal;"><strong>attributes</strong>(<i>x</i>);</code></pre>
        </div>

        <h3>Arguments</h3>

        <table>
            
<dt>x</dt>
<dd><p><p>any R object</p></p></dd>

        </table>


        <h3 style="display: block;">Details</h3>

        <p>Unlike attr it is not an error to set attributes on a NULL object:<br />
 it will first be coerced to an empty list.</p>

<p>Note that some attributes (namely Class, comment, Dim, dimnames, <br />
 names, row.names And tsp) are treated specially And have restrictions<br />
 On the values which can be Set. (Note that this Is Not True Of <br />
 levels which should be Set For factors via the levels replacement <br />
 Function.)</p>

<p>Attributes are Not stored internally As a list And should be thought<br />
 Of As a Set And Not a vector, i.e, the order Of the elements Of <br />
 attributes() does Not matter. This Is also reflected by identical()'s<br />
 behaviour with the default argument attrib.as.set = TRUE. Attributes <br />
 must have unique names (and NA is taken as "NA", not a missing value).</p>

<p>Assigning attributes first removes all attributes, Then sets any Dim <br />
 attribute And Then the remaining attributes In the order given: this<br />
 ensures that setting a Dim attribute always precedes the dimnames <br />
 attribute.</p>

<p>The mostattributes assignment takes special care For the Dim, names And<br />
 dimnames attributes, And assigns them only When known To be valid <br />
 whereas an attributes assignment would give an Error If any are Not. <br />
 It Is principally intended For arrays, And should be used With care<br />
 On classed objects. For example, it does Not check that row.names<br />
 are assigned correctly For data frames.</p>

<p>The names Of a pairlist are Not stored As attributes, but are reported <br />
 As If they were (And can be Set by the replacement form Of attributes).</p>

<p>NULL objects cannot have attributes And attempts To assign them will<br />
 promote the Object To an empty list. Both assignment And replacement<br />
 forms Of attributes are primitive functions.</p>
