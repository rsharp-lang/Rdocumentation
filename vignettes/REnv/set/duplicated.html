        <h2>Determine Duplicate Elements</h2>

        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p><br /> <code>duplicated()</code> determines which elements of a vector or data frame <br /> are duplicates of elements with smaller subscripts, and returns a <br /> logical vector indicating which elements (rows) are duplicates.</p>

        <h3>Usage</h3>

        <div style="width: 100%; padding-left: 3%; color: black;">
            <pre><code class='language-R' style="color: black; font-weight:normal;"><strong>duplicated</strong>(<i>x</i>);</code></pre>
        </div>

        <h3>Arguments</h3>

        <table>
            
<dt>x</dt>
<dd><p>a vector Or a data frame Or an array Or NULL.</p></dd>

        </table>


        <h3 style="display: block;">Details</h3>

        <p>These are generic functions with methods for vectors (including lists), data frames 
 and arrays (including matrices).</p>

<p>For the default methods, And whenever there are equivalent method definitions for 
 duplicated And anyDuplicated, anyDuplicated(x, ...) Is a “generalized” shortcut 
 for any(duplicated(x, ...)), in the sense that it returns the index i of the first 
 duplicated entry x[i] if there Is one, And 0 otherwise. Their behaviours may be 
 different when at least one of duplicated And anyDuplicated has a relevant method.</p>

<p>duplicated(x, fromLast = TRUE) Is equivalent to but faster than rev(duplicated(rev(x))).</p>

<p>The data frame method works by pasting together a character representation Of the 
 rows separated by \r, so may be imperfect If the data frame has characters With 
 embedded carriage returns Or columns which Do Not reliably map To characters.</p>

<p>The array method calculates For Each element Of the Sub-array specified by MARGIN 
 If the remaining dimensions are identical To those For an earlier (Or later, When 
 fromLast = True) element (In row-major order). This would most commonly be used 
 To find duplicated rows (the Default) Or columns (With MARGIN = 2). Note that 
 MARGIN = 0 returns an array Of the same dimensionality attributes As x.</p>

<p>Missing values("NA") are regarded As equal, numeric And complex ones differing from 
 NaN; character strings will be compared In a “common encoding”; For details, see 
 match (And unique) which use the same concept.</p>

<p>Values in incomparables will never be marked as duplicated. This Is intended to be 
 used for a fairly small set of values And will Not be efficient for a very large 
 set.</p>

<p>When used on a data frame with more than one column, Or an array Or matrix when 
 comparing dimensions of length greater than one, this tests for identity of character 
 representations. This will catch people who unwisely rely on exact equality of 
 floating-point numbers!</p>

<p>Except for factors, logical And raw vectors the default nmax = NA Is equivalent 
 to nmax = length(x). Since a hash table of size 8*nmax bytes Is allocated, setting 
 nmax suitably can save large amounts of memory. For factors it Is automatically 
 set to the smaller of length(x) And the number of levels plus one (for NA). 
 If nmax Is set too small there Is liable to be an error nmax = 1 Is silently 
 ignored.</p>

<p>Long vectors are supported For the Default method Of duplicated, but may only be 
 usable if nmax Is supplied.</p>

        <h3>Value</h3>

        <p>duplicated(): For a vector input, a logical vector of the 
 same length as x. For a data frame, a logical vector with one element 
 for each row. For a matrix or array, and when MARGIN = 0, a logical 
 array with the same dimensions and dimnames.</p><h4>clr value class</h4><ul><li><i>any</i> kind</li></ul>
