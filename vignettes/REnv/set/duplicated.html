        <h2>Determine Duplicate Elements</h2>

        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p><br /> <code>duplicated()</code> determines which elements of a vector or data frame <br /> are duplicates of elements with smaller subscripts, and returns a <br /> logical vector indicating which elements (rows) are duplicates.</p>

        <h3>Usage</h3>

        <div style="width: 100%; padding-left: 3%; color: black;">
            <pre><code class='language-R' style="color: black; font-weight:normal;"><strong>duplicated</strong>(<i>x</i>);</code></pre>
        </div>

        <h3>Arguments</h3>

        <table>
            
<dt>x</dt>
<dd><p><p>a vector Or a data frame Or an array Or NULL.</p></p></dd>

        </table>


        <h3 style="display: block;">Details</h3>

        <p>These are generic functions with methods for vectors (including lists), data frames <br />
 and arrays (including matrices).</p>

<p>For the default methods, And whenever there are equivalent method definitions for <br />
 duplicated And anyDuplicated, anyDuplicated(x, ...) Is a “generalized” shortcut <br />
 for any(duplicated(x, ...)), in the sense that it returns the index i of the first <br />
 duplicated entry x[i] if there Is one, And 0 otherwise. Their behaviours may be <br />
 different when at least one of duplicated And anyDuplicated has a relevant method.</p>

<p>duplicated(x, fromLast = TRUE) Is equivalent to but faster than rev(duplicated(rev(x))).</p>

<p>The data frame method works by pasting together a character representation Of the <br />
 rows separated by \r, so may be imperfect If the data frame has characters With <br />
 embedded carriage returns Or columns which Do Not reliably map To characters.</p>

<p>The array method calculates For Each element Of the Sub-array specified by MARGIN <br />
 If the remaining dimensions are identical To those For an earlier (Or later, When <br />
 fromLast = True) element (In row-major order). This would most commonly be used <br />
 To find duplicated rows (the Default) Or columns (With MARGIN = 2). Note that <br />
 MARGIN = 0 returns an array Of the same dimensionality attributes As x.</p>

<p>Missing values("NA") are regarded As equal, numeric And complex ones differing from <br />
 NaN; character strings will be compared In a “common encoding”; For details, see <br />
 match (And unique) which use the same concept.</p>

<p>Values in incomparables will never be marked as duplicated. This Is intended to be <br />
 used for a fairly small set of values And will Not be efficient for a very large <br />
 set.</p>

<p>When used on a data frame with more than one column, Or an array Or matrix when <br />
 comparing dimensions of length greater than one, this tests for identity of character <br />
 representations. This will catch people who unwisely rely on exact equality of <br />
 floating-point numbers!</p>

<p>Except for factors, logical And raw vectors the default nmax = NA Is equivalent <br />
 to nmax = length(x). Since a hash table of size 8*nmax bytes Is allocated, setting <br />
 nmax suitably can save large amounts of memory. For factors it Is automatically <br />
 set to the smaller of length(x) And the number of levels plus one (for NA). <br />
 If nmax Is set too small there Is liable to be an error nmax = 1 Is silently <br />
 ignored.</p>

<p>Long vectors are supported For the Default method Of duplicated, but may only be <br />
 usable if nmax Is supplied.</p>


        <h3>Value</h3>

        <p>duplicated(): For a vector input, a logical vector of the <br />
 same length as x. For a data frame, a logical vector with one element <br />
 for each row. For a matrix or array, and when MARGIN = 0, a logical <br />
 array with the same dimensions and dimnames.</p><h4>clr value class</h4><ul><li><i>any</i> kind</li></ul>
