        <h2>Sequence Generation</h2>

        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p><br /> Generate regular sequences. seq is a standard generic with a default method. <br /> seq.int is a primitive which can be much faster but has a few restrictions. <br /> seq_along and seq_len are very fast primitives for two common cases.</p>

        <h3>Usage</h3>

        <div style="width: 100%; padding-left: 3%; color: black;">
            <pre><code class='language-R' style="color: black; font-weight:normal;"><strong>seq</strong>(<i>from</i>, <i>to</i>,
    <i>by</i> = <span style='color: green;'>1</span>);</code></pre>
        </div>

        <h3>Arguments</h3>

        <table>
            
<dt>from</dt>
<dd><p><p>the starting And (maximal) End values Of the sequence. <br />
 Of length 1 unless just from Is supplied As an unnamed argument.</p></p></dd>


<dt>[to]</dt>
<dd><p><p>the starting And (maximal) End values Of the sequence. <br />
 Of length 1 unless just from Is supplied As an unnamed argument.</p></p></dd>


<dt>by</dt>
<dd><p><p>number: increment of the sequence.</p></p></dd>

        </table>


        <h3 style="display: block;">Details</h3>

        <p>Numerical inputs should all be finite (that is, not infinite, NaN or NA).<br />
 The interpretation Of the unnamed arguments Of seq And seq.int Is Not standard, <br />
 And it Is recommended always To name the arguments When programming.</p>

<p>seq Is generic, And only the default method Is described here. Note that it <br />
 dispatches on the class of the first argument irrespective of argument names. <br />
 This can have unintended consequences if it Is called with just one argument <br />
 intending this to be taken as along.with it Is much better to use seq_along <br />
 in that case.</p>

<p>seq.int Is an internal generic which dispatches on methods for "seq" based on <br />
 the class of the first supplied argument (before argument matching).</p>

<p>Typical usages are</p>

<ul>
<li>seq(from, to)</li>
<li>seq(from, to, by= )</li>
<li>seq(from, to, length.out= )</li>
<li>seq(along.with= )</li>
<li>seq(from)</li>
<li><p>seq(length.out= )</p>

<p>The first form generates the sequence from, from+/-1, ..., To (identical To <br />
from:to).</p>

<p>The second form generates from, from+by, ..., up To the sequence value less <br />
than Or equal To To. Specifying To - from And by Of opposite signs Is an Error. <br />
Note that the computed final value can go just beyond To To allow For rounding <br />
Error, but Is truncated To To. ('Just beyondâ€™ is by up to 1e-10 times<br />
abs(from - to).)</p>

<p>The third generates a sequence Of length.out equally spaced values from from To <br />
To. (length.out Is usually abbreviated To length Or len, And seq_len Is much <br />
faster.)</p>

<p>The fourth form generates the Integer sequence 1, 2, ..., length(along.With). <br />
(along.With Is usually abbreviated To along, And seq_along Is much faster.)</p>

<p>The fifth form generates the sequence 1, 2, ..., length(from) (As If argument <br />
along.With had been specified), unless the argument Is numeric Of length 1 When <br />
it Is interpreted As 1:from (even for seq(0) for compatibility with S). Using <br />
either seq_along Or seq_len Is much preferred (unless strict S compatibility <br />
Is essential).</p>

<p>The final form generates the Integer sequence 1, 2, ..., length.out unless <br />
length.out = 0, When it generates Integer(0).</p>

<p>Very small sequences (With from - To Of the order Of 10^{-14} times the larger <br />
Of the ends) will Return from.</p>

<p>For seq(only), up To two Of from, To And by can be supplied As complex values <br />
provided length.out Or along.With Is specified. More generally, the Default <br />
method Of seq will handle classed objects With methods For the Math, Ops <br />
And Summary group generics.</p>

<p>seq.int, seq_along And seq_len are primitive.</p></li>
</ul>
