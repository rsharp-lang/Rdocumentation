        <h2>Sequence Generation</h2>

        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p><br /> Generate regular sequences. seq is a standard generic with a default method. <br /> seq.int is a primitive which can be much faster but has a few restrictions. <br /> seq<em>along and seq</em>len are very fast primitives for two common cases.</p>

        <h3>Usage</h3>

        <div style="width: 100%; padding-left: 3%; color: black;">
            <pre><code class='language-R' style="color: black; font-weight:normal;"><strong>seq</strong>(<i>from</i>, <i>to</i>,
    <i>by</i> = <span style='color: green;'>NaN</span>,
    <i>length.out</i> = <span style='color: green;'>-1</span>);</code></pre>
        </div>

        <h3>Arguments</h3>

        <table>
            
<dt>from</dt>
<dd><p>the starting And (maximal) End values Of the sequence. 
 Of length 1 unless just from Is supplied As an unnamed argument.</p></dd>


<dt>[to]</dt>
<dd><p>the starting And (maximal) End values Of the sequence. 
 Of length 1 unless just from Is supplied As an unnamed argument.</p></dd>


<dt>by</dt>
<dd><p>number: increment of the sequence. [as double]</p></dd>

        <h3 style="display: block;">Details</h3>

        <p>Numerical inputs should all be finite (that is, not infinite, NaN or NA).
 The interpretation Of the unnamed arguments Of seq And seq.int Is Not standard, 
 And it Is recommended always To name the arguments When programming.
 
 seq Is generic, And only the default method Is described here. Note that it 
 dispatches on the class of the first argument irrespective of argument names. 
 This can have unintended consequences if it Is called with just one argument 
 intending this to be taken as along.with it Is much better to use seq_along 
 in that case.
 
 seq.int Is an internal generic which dispatches on methods for "seq" based on 
 the class of the first supplied argument (before argument matching).
 
 Typical usages are
 
 + seq(from, to)
 + seq(from, to, by= )
 + seq(from, to, length.out= )
 + seq(along.with= )
 + seq(from)
 + seq(length.out= )
 
 The first form generates the sequence from, from+/-1, ..., To (identical To 
 from:to).</p>

<p>The second form generates from, from+by, ..., up To the sequence value less 
 than Or equal To To. Specifying To - from And by Of opposite signs Is an Error. 
 Note that the computed final value can go just beyond To To allow For rounding 
 Error, but Is truncated To To. ('Just beyondâ€™ is by up to 1e-10 times
 abs(from - to).)</p>

<p>The third generates a sequence Of length.out equally spaced values from from To 
 To. (length.out Is usually abbreviated To length Or len, And seq_len Is much 
 faster.)</p>

<p>The fourth form generates the Integer sequence 1, 2, ..., length(along.With). 
 (along.With Is usually abbreviated To along, And seq_along Is much faster.)</p>

<p>The fifth form generates the sequence 1, 2, ..., length(from) (As If argument 
 along.With had been specified), unless the argument Is numeric Of length 1 When 
 it Is interpreted As 1:from (even for seq(0) for compatibility with S). Using 
 either seq<em>along Or seq</em>len Is much preferred (unless strict S compatibility 
 Is essential).</p>

<p>The final form generates the Integer sequence 1, 2, ..., length.out unless 
 length.out = 0, When it generates Integer(0).</p>

<p>Very small sequences (With from - To Of the order Of 10^{-14} times the larger 
 Of the ends) will Return from.</p>

<p>For seq(only), up To two Of from, To And by can be supplied As complex values 
 provided length.out Or along.With Is specified. More generally, the Default 
 method Of seq will handle classed objects With methods For the Math, Ops 
 And Summary group generics.</p>

<p>seq.int, seq<em>along And seq</em>len are primitive.</p>
