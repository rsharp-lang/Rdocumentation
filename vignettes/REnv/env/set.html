        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p><br /> Assign a value to a name in an environment.</p>

        <h3>Usage</h3>

        <div style="width: 100%; padding-left: 3%; color: black;">
            <pre><code class='language-R' style="color: black; font-weight:normal;"><strong>set</strong>(<i>name</i>, <i>value</i>);</code></pre>
        </div>

        <h3>Arguments</h3>

        <table>
            
<dt>env</dt>
<dd><p><p>the environment To use. See 'Detailsâ€™.</p></p></dd>


<dt>name</dt>
<dd><p><p>a variable name, given as a character string. No coercion is done, <br />
 and the first element of a character vector of length greater than <br />
 one will be used, with a warning.</p></p></dd>


<dt>value</dt>
<dd><p><p>a value To be assigned To x.</p></p></dd>

        </table>


        <h3 style="display: block;">Details</h3>

        <p>There are no restrictions on the name given as x: it can be a <br />
 non-syntactic name (see make.names).<br />
 The pos argument can specify the environment In which To assign <br />
 the Object In any Of several ways: as -1 (the default), as a <br />
 positive integer (the position in the search list); as the <br />
 character string name of an element in the search list; Or as <br />
 an environment (including using sys.frame to access the currently <br />
 active function calls). The envir argument Is an alternative way <br />
 to specify an environment, but Is primarily for back compatibility.<br />
 assign does Not dispatch assignment methods, so it cannot be used <br />
 To Set elements Of vectors, names, attributes, etc.<br />
 Note that assignment To an attached list Or data frame changes the <br />
 attached copy And Not the original Object: see attach And With.</p>


        <h3>Value</h3>

        <p>This function is invoked for its side effect, which is assigning <br />
 value to the variable x. If no envir is specified, then the assignment <br />
 takes place in the currently active environment.<br />
 If inherits Is TRUE, enclosing environments of the supplied environment <br />
 are searched until the variable x Is encountered. The value Is Then <br />
 assigned In the environment In which the variable Is encountered <br />
 (provided that the binding Is Not locked: see lockBinding : If it Is, <br />
 an error Is signaled). If the symbol Is Not encountered Then assignment <br />
 takes place In the user's workspace (the global environment).<br />
 If inherits Is FALSE, assignment takes place in the initial frame of <br />
 envir, unless an existing binding Is locked Or there Is no existing <br />
 binding And the environment Is locked (when an error Is signaled).</p><h4>clr value class</h4><ul><li><i>any</i> kind</li></ul>
