        <h2>Ordering Permutation</h2>

        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p><br /> order returns a permutation which rearranges its first argument <br /> into ascending or descending order, breaking ties by further <br /> arguments. sort.list is the same, using only one argument.</p>

        <h3>Usage</h3>

        <div style="width: 100%; padding-left: 3%; color: black;">
            <pre><code class='language-R' style="color: black; font-weight:normal;"><strong>order</strong>(<i>x</i>,
    <i>decreasing</i> = <span style='color: blue !important;'>FALSE</span>);</code></pre>
        </div>

        <h3>Arguments</h3>

        <table>
            
<dt>x</dt>
<dd><p><p>a sequence of numeric, complex, character or <br />
 logical vectors, all of the same length, or a classed R object.</p></p></dd>


<dt>decreasing</dt>
<dd><p><p>logical. Should the sort order be increasing or decreasing? <br />
 For the "radix" method, this can be a vector of length equal to <br />
 the number of arguments in .... For the other methods, it must <br />
 be length one.</p></p></dd>

        </table>


        <h3 style="display: block;">Details</h3>

        <p>In the case of ties in the first vector, values in the second are <br />
 used to break the ties. If the values are still tied, values in <br />
 the later arguments are used to break the tie (see the first <br />
 example). The sort used is stable (except for method = "quick"), <br />
 so any unresolved ties will be left in their original ordering.</p>

<p>Complex values are sorted first by the real part, then the imaginary <br />
 part.</p>

<p>Except for method "radix", the sort order for character vectors will <br />
 depend on the collating sequence of the locale in use: see <br />
 Comparison.</p>

<p>The "shell" method is generally the safest bet and is the default <br />
 method, except for short factors, numeric vectors, integer vectors <br />
 and logical vectors, where "radix" is assumed. Method "radix" stably <br />
 sorts logical, numeric and character vectors in linear time. It <br />
 outperforms the other methods, although there are caveats (see sort). <br />
 Method "quick" for sort.list is only supported for numeric x with <br />
 na.last = NA, is not stable, and is slower than "radix".</p>

<p>partial = NULL is supported for compatibility with other implementations <br />
 of S, but no other values are accepted and ordering is always complete.</p>

<p>For a classed R object, the sort order is taken from xtfrm: as its help <br />
 page notes, this can be slow unless a suitable method has been defined <br />
 or is.numeric(x) is true. For factors, this sorts on the internal <br />
 codes, which is particularly appropriate for ordered factors.</p>


        <h3>Value</h3>

        <p>An integer vector unless any of the inputs has 2^31 or <br />
 more elements, when it is a double vector.</p><h4>clr value class</h4><ul><li>integer</li></ul>
